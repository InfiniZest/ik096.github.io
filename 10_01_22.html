                Happy October, here’s a snapshot of what’s been going on lately. In the past 2 weeks, I’ve been struggling to solve the Test24 problem from Chapter 12 of Introduction to Programming and Data Structures with C++ by Y. Liang. The question states to create an algorithm that creates an expression given four unique operands between 1 and 13 (inclusive) where the total of that expression equals 24. The expression can use parentheses in any combination and use any operator (i.e. addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division). Since this chapter involves using stacks and vectors, I can assume using a stack could be a possible solution. There is however one issue that arises, that being, how do I create an expression using numbers that are restricted to a last-in-first-out approach. I’m keeping this in mind while I begin tracing solutions for a series of number combinations to figure out a possible pattern such that I can have a potential algorithm in mind for creating expressions equal to 24. I’ll most likely create a separate article on my finding and approach to the solution once I get there.

                On the JS side of things, I have been working on using Kaboom.js to create basic actions for my Mr.Driller web-based game. This is based of Namco’s classic arcade game of the same name. The logic of the level design has been implemented for the first level; I now want to work with Kaboom to implement basic actions for the player character.  The use of object-like arrays to define characteristics of objects seems self-explanatory but the next step is learning more characteristics to apply actions to the objects. Player movement is not hard to implement. Simply using the onKeyDown method and directing what property to move (in this case the character) isn’t bad. The next step is to apply collision. Knowing when block objects are colliding with other blocks, forming block clusters, or when the player is colliding with a block is essential to creating the basic mechanics of the game. The next step is fix collision of the player such that when it touches a block, the player can either break it or climb on top of it.

                On the typography design, I’ve begun learning letter spacing, tracking, and kerning. Using these techniques help to create more readable text and less wasted space. Making accessible text is going to be fundamental when it comes to designing larger projects that involve the use of text. Nigel French is a great instructor for holding your hand through designing visually pleasing and accessible type, so I highly recommend you check his works and learning resources.  I will get to applying these resources in CSS or inDesign. It’s been quite some time since I’ve used the software but I’m eager to come back and reformat some of my own outlines to understand a method that works best to read outlines.

                There’s a lot of work to go through with potential opened, I just got to fight and endure the weight of the burden. The hardest part is delving deep into something I cannot clearly see, I can only apply what I already understand and habituation of past experiences to help connect those dots and find a solution.
